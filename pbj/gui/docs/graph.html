<h2>XTrain</h2>

<p>To get started, simply choose one of the Dehn twist menu items, hit
Enter, and look at the information that appears in the main window.</p>

<p>Self-maps of graphs are given in the following format:</p>

<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------
8 // number of edges
3 // number of vertices
// format: edge: (initial, terminal vertex) --> image
a: (v1, v2) --> d
b: (v0, v2) --> bfedagC
c: (v1, v0) --> Ac
d: (v2, v1) --> e
e: (v1, v2) --> f
f: (v2, v1) --> hb
g: (v2, v0) --> ag
h: (v1, v0) --> g
HcGADEFBCadefhbg // fixed word

label: nice_map

marking:
2 // number of loops
// format: label: loop
d0: DE
d2: HcGADEFBGAcGADEFBGAcGADEFB
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>The fixed word, label, and marking are optional. The
fixed word is required to be preserved (up to free
homotopy). The loops in the marking are loops in the
graph (capital letters denote edges with reversed
orientation).</p>

<p>If an edge is mapped to a point, its image string
must be the underscore character ('_').</p>

<p>Comment lines beginning with '//' are allowed at any
point.</p>

<p>The menu items are intended to be self-explanatory.
The terminology is consistent with Bestvina-Handel:
'Train Tracks for Surface Homeomorphisms.'</p>

<p>You can enter maps of graphs manually, read them from
files, or compute them as compositions of Dehn twists
(see help text for Dehn twists).</p>
