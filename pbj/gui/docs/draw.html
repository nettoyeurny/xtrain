<h2>Train Track Graphics</h2>

<p>This module draws pictures of train tracks according to
Bestvina-Handel: 'Train Tracks for Surface Homeomorphisms.'
The algorithm that computes these pictures can be found
in P. Brinkmann: 'An Implementation of the Bestvina-Handel
Algorithm for Surface Homeomorphisms.'</p>

<p>The identification pattern on the boundary of the polygons
is given by matching labels of edges intersecting the boundary,
and the puncture corresponds to the vertices of the polygon.</p>

<p>Singularities of the stable or unstable foliation of the
pseudo-Anosov map in question correspond either to the
puncture or to shaded areas containing at least three
edges. If a shaded area contains k>=3 edges, it gives
rise to a singularity of index 1-k/2. For the proofs of
these statements, see Fathi-Laudenbach-Poenaru: 'Travaux
de Thurston sur les surfaces.'</p>

<p>Since the sum of the indices of all singularities equals
the Euler characteristic of the surface with the puncture
closed, we can compute the index of the singularity at the
puncture, if any.  Moreover, the singularities of the two
foliations are fixed points or periodic points of the
pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism in question.  There are more
periodic points than just the singularities of the foliations
--- in fact, the set of periodic points of a pseudo-Anosov
homeomorphism is dense.</p>

<p>Most of the menu items should be self-explanatory, except
possibly the one labeled 'Export psfrag'.
psfrag is a LaTeX package the allows users to replace
labels in PostScript figures by LaTeX labels. This
module automatically generates psfrag code for pictures
of train tracks.
For example, if you save a picture to the file 'foo.eps,'
and then export the corresponding psfrag code to
'foo-psfrag.tex,'
then you can use it in LaTeX files in the following way
(assuming that you are using LaTeX2e and epsf; the
psfrag code generated by this module should work with
any (reasonably recent) version of LaTeX, though):</p>
