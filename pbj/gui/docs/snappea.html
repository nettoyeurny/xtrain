<h2>SnapPea and XTrain</h2>

<p>The SnapPea connectivity of XTrain serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It computes certain geometric properties of the mapping torus of a
pseudo-Anosov map, such as volume and fundamental group.</li>
<li>It checks whether the mapping torus of the current map is isometric
to a given manifold in the census.  Elements of the census are selected
by name, e.g., <code>m134</code>.</li>
<li>It checks whether the mapping torus of the current map is isometric
to a manifold read from a file.  In order to compare the mapping tori of
two pseudo-Anosov maps, for instance, you can simply load the first map
into XTrain, export it to SnapPea (i.e., write a triangulation to a
file), then load the next map into XTrain and check for isometry to the
file you created before.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing SnapPea</h2>

<p>In order to call SnapPea from within XTrain, you need to have SnapPeaPython
installed.  Point your browser to <a
href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~t3m/">http://www.math.uic.edu/~t3m/</a>
and download the tarball <code>SnapPeaPython.tgz</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a shell and go to the directory that contains the tarball you
just downloaded.</li>
<li>Unpack the tarball by typing <code>tar xzf
SnapPeaPython.tgz</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>cd SnapPeaPython</code>.</li>
<li>Compile SnapPea by typing <code>python setup.py build</code>.</li>
<li>Install the Python bindings for SnapPea by typing <code>python
setup.py install</code>.  On some systems, you may need to have root
privileges to install the package (say <code>sudo python setup.py
install</code> in this case).</li>
</ul>
